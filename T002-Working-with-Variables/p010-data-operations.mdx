    <Prompt>

Do these two expressions have different results in Python?

1. `flowers = flowers + 2` 
2. `flowers += 2`

    </Prompt>
    <Answer>

These two expressions do the same thing in Python! The `+=` operator is a shortcut for adding the value 2 to the value of `flowers` and then reassigning the variable `flowers` to hold the new result. If the original value of `flowers` was 8, both lines of code would update the value of `flowers` to 10.
