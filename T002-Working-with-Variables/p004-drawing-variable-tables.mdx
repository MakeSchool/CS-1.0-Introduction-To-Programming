# What is a variable table?

Let's practice an easy way of keeping track of variables and their values when we read more complicated code: **Variable Tables**.

**Variable tables** include variable names along with their values at each line of code to help you understand how the value changes throughout a program. Let's look at at how they are created:

This is a section of code to store score values in a video game.

```python
# Here are two variables that store data representing scores for a video game
my_score = 30
high_score = 60

#let's use variable reassignment to update the scores!
my_score = 31
my_score = 99
high_score = my_score
```

The variable table for this code contains each line of code in order and looks like this:

| Line # | Variable   | Value |
| ------ | ---------- | ----- |
| 2      | `my_score`   | 30    |
| 3      | `high_score` | 60    |
| 6      | `my_score`   | 31    |
| 7      | `my_score`   | 99    |
| 8      | `high_score` | 99    |

Let's look at the table entry for line 8: can you explain in your own words why the value in the table is 99?

<TextResponse>
  <Prompt>

On line 8 of the table, why is the value of of `high_score` 99?

  </Prompt>
  <Explanation>

`my_score` is assigned 30, then 31, then 99. `high_score` starts at 60 on line 3. Then, `high_score` gets assigned the value of `my_score` on line 8, which is 99.

## Create Your Own Variable Table

<Action>

Candy break! Draw your own variable table by walking through each line of the following code.

</Action>

```python
# Let's count some candy bars
number_of_kit_kats = 20
number_of_skittles = 70
number_of_hi_chews = 15

number_of_kit_kats = 88
number_of_skittles = number_of_kit_kats
number_of_kit_kats = number_of_hi_chews
number_of_hi_chews = number_of_skittles
```

## Check Your Understanding

<MultipleChoice>
  <Prompt>

What is the value of `number_of_kitkats` when the program finishes?

  </Prompt>

  <Choice>20</Choice>
  <Choice correct>70</Choice>
  <Choice>15</Choice>
  <Choice>88</Choice>
