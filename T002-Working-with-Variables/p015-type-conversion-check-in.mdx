# Question: check your knowledge of Type Conversion

<FlashCard>
<Prompt>

This code throws an error in the Python Console! How could you use type conversion to fix it?

```python
runner_number = 12
name_tag = "Boston Marathon: runner " + runner_number
```

</Prompt>
<Answer>

You can use the built-in function `str()` to convert the integer `runner_number` into a string that works in this expression.

`name_tag = "Boston Marathon: runner " + str(runner_number)`
