# Creating Variables

You just learned about one of the most important building blocks of Python: **Variables**! Follow
the steps in this exercise to practice creating and updating your own variables in the Python
console.

## Steps to Complete

1. Type the line `age = 22` into the console and press Enter on your keyboard.

2. Now enter the line `age`. What does the console output in response? Why do you think it gave you
   that value?

3. Let's make another variable in the console called `your_age` and assign it the value of how old
   you are. How can you check the value of the variable `your_age` after you initialize it?

4. Now try reassigning the value of `age` to `your_age` using the line `age = your_age` in the
   console. When you type `age` again and press Enter, what do you see? Why?

5. Choose your own variable to initialize! Try reassigning it to a new value.
