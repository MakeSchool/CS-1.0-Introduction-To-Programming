What's a scenario where you might get a TypeError in Python? What about a ValueError?

</Prompt>
<Answer>

One way you might see a TypeError message from the Python interpreter is if you try to perform an operation on mismatched types like a string and an integer. You can solve this error with type casting, but some data types can’t be converted to every other data type. If you try to convert the string 'hi' to a float, you will get a ValueError.
