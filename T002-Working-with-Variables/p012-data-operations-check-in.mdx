What would the value of `years` be after running these lines of code in the Python Console?

```python
years = 15
years += 3
```

</Prompt>
<Answer>

The line `years += 3` is adding `3` to the original value of years `15`, then updating the variable `years` to contain the new result. So `years` now stores the value `18`.
