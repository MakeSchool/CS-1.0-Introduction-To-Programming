<Prompt>

If you were building a GPS app that tells a user how to travel to a destination on a map, what are three values that you might store as a **variable** in your code?

</Prompt>
<Answer>

Here are three variables you might want to use for a GPS app!

* **destination** - contains the gps coordinates of the location that the user wants to travel to
* **travel_time** - contains the time in minutes that it will take to get to the destination
* **traffic_condition** - contains a number between 1 and 10 describing how heavy the traffic is on the route

How is the equals symbol `=` used in Python?

</Prompt>
<Answer>

`=` is the **assignment operator**. You can use it to tell Python to assign a variable name as the label to get a value. In this line of code, we store the value `12` in the computer's memory, and tell Python to label that value with the name `cupcakes`, so that we can access it later.

`cupcakes = 12`

If we run these three lines of code in the Python Console, what value will be stored in the variable `playlist_length`?

```python
favorite_songs = 42
playlist_length = 0
playlist_length = favorite_songs

```

</Prompt>
<Answer>

`playlist_length` will have the value `42`. First we initialize `favorite_songs` with the value `42`, then `playlist_length` with the value `0`. The last line **reassigns** the value of `playlist_length` to be the same as the value of `favorite_songs`.
