# Working Together

Combine your type conversion and string operator skills to write some music in Python! :notes: Dolly
Parton's 9 to 5 won the Grammy award for song of the year in 1982. The song Let It Be by the Beatles
was on their studio album of the same name that got nominated for record of the year in 1971. Follow
the steps in this exercise to store them both in Python.

## Steps to Complete

1. Let's start with Dolly Parton's song 9 to 5! Create the variable `start_time` and assign it the
   integer value `9`. Then create the variable `end_time` with the value `5`.

2. Use string concatenation to add together the three pieces of the song title by entering the line
   `start_time + 'to' + end_time` in the console. Python will give you an error like we saw in the
   previous video when you run this line of code. How can you fix the error using the built-in type
   conversion functions that we learned about?

3. Store the title you created in a variable called `song_title`.

4. Now how about a Beatles song? Store each of the lines of the song Let It Be shown below in a
   variable. Use the string operators `+` and `*` to make this easier! For example
   `line_1 = 'hi ' * 4` would create the value `hi hi hi hi `. Which line of Let It Be could use
   this same operation?

**Let It Be**

- When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
- Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
- And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me
- Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
- Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
- Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
