# Adding It Up

In the last video you learned how use data operations to manipulate and change the values in your
Python variables. This is another big step toward putting together Python programs that can do
useful tasks! Follow the steps in this exercise to practice the arithmetic operators.

## Steps to Complete

1. Initialize the variable `num_fish` with the integer value `8` :fish:

2. Intialize the variable `num_hamsters` with the integer value `2` :hamster:

3. Enter the line `num_fish + num_hamsters` into the console. How many pets are there total? How can
   you assign the results of that data operation to a variable named `total_pets`?

4. Initialize two of your own variables! Then use your two variables to try out each of the four
   arithmetic operators that we talked about in the last video.
