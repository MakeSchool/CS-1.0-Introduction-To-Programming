# Adding It Up

# Step 1: Initialize the variable num_fish with the integer value 8.

# Step 2: Intialize the variable num_hamsters with the integer value 2.

# Step 3: Enter the line num_fish + num_hamsters into the console. How many pets are there total? How can you assign the results of that data operation to a variable named total_pets?

# Step 4: Initialize two of your own variables! Then use your two variables to try out each of the four arithmentic operators that we talked about in the last video.
