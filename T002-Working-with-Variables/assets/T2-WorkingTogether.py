# Working Together

# Step 1: Let's start with Dolly Parton's song 9 to 5! Create the variable start_time and assign it the integer value 9. Then create the variable end_time with the value 5.

# Step 2: Use string concatenation to add together the three pieces of the song title by entering the line start_time + 'to' + end_time in the console.  Python will give you an error like we saw in the previous video when you run this line of code. How can you fix the error using the built-in type conversion functions that we learned about?  

# Step 3: Store the title you created in a variable called song_title

# Step 4: Now how about a Beatles song? Store each of the lines of the song Let It Be shown below in a variable. Use the string operators + and * to make this easier! For example line_1 = 'hi ' * 4 would create the value 'hi hi hi hi '. Which line of Let It Be could use this same operation?

# Let It Be
# When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
# Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
# And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me
# Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
# Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
# Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
