# Creating Variables

# Step 1: Type the line age = 22 into the console and press Enter on your keyboard.

# Step 2: Now enter the line age. What does the console output in response? Why do you think it gave you that value?

# Step 3: Let's make another variable in the console called your_age and assign it the value of how old you are. How can you check the value of the variable your_age after you initialize it?

# Step 4: Now try reassigning the value of age to your_age using the line age = your_age in the console. When you type age again and press Enter, what do you see?  Why?

# Step 5: Choose your own variable to initialize! Try reassigning it to a new value.
