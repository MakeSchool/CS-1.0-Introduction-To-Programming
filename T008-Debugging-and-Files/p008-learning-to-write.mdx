# Learning to Write

To properly prep for Sunday Night Football, you want to go shopping for your favorite snacks! :cookie: Let's create a shopping list with your favorite snacks to eat!

## Steps to Complete

1. Create a list called `snacks` of at least 4 strings containing your favorite snacks.

2. Open a new file called `shopping_list.txt` in write mode as `list_file`.

3. Finish the loop to write your favorite snacks to the shopping list file.

4. Oh no! The loop above overwrites the file with each line, so we end up with only the last snack in the file. Let's fix this. Create a function called `write_shopping_list()` that takes 2 parameters: `filename` (the file to write to), and `snacks` (a list of strings). The function should use `.writelines()` to write your list of snacks to the filename.
