# Check your understanding of reading files

<FlashCard>
<Prompt>

Let's practice reading Python documentation! Read the documentation for the `open()` function here: [https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open). What is another mode that you could use other than 'r' when calling `open()`?

</Prompt>
<Answer>

Another mode listed in the documentation is 't', or text mode. Unlike with 'b' (binary) mode, where the data from the file is read into Python as **bytes**, text mode reads the file in as a string.

<Prompt>

Why do we need to close files when we're done accessing them?

</Prompt>
<Answer>

One reason might be that other code in a complicated system could be waiting to use the file and can't access it until the file has been closed.

Another reason could be that when we write to files, Python doesn't usually write data to a file right away. The data may spend time in something called a **buffer** until the file is closed and the buffer is cleared. If you end the program without closing a file some of that data could be lost!
