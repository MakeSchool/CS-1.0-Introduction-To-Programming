<Prompt>

What is the difference between the three modes that you can use for the built-in function `open()` -
r, w, a?

</Prompt>
<Answer>

- r - This mode _reads_ a file. You can't edit the file in `r` mode!
- w - This mode _writes_ to a file. The key here is that this mode *over*writes the file. You'll
  lose the original data if you write to the file in this mode.
- a - This mode _appends_ to a file. You can use append mode to add more data to the end of an
  existing file.
