<Prompt>

What is the difference between the three modes that you can use for the built-in function `open()` - r, w, a?

</Prompt>
<Answer>

* r - This mode *reads* a file. You can't edit the file in `r` mode!
* w - This mode *writes* to a file. The key here is that this mode *over*writes the file. You'll lose the original data if you write to the file in this mode.
* a - This mode *appends* to a file. You can use append mode to add more data to the end of an existing file.
