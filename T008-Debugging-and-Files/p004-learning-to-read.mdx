# Learning to Read :book:

Let's learn how to read ... in Python!

## Steps to Complete

1. Store file name in a variable. If you look at the Replit file explorer tab, you'll see that we've included a file named `languages.txt` for you to read from.

2. Open the file in read mode ('r')

3. Use `len()` to find out how many lines you read in from the file

4. Use list indexing to print out the line at index 320

5. Using a for loop and `.readlines()`, read and print the first 5 lines of the file. Remember that you can use `range()` to control how many iterations a for loop will run for.

6. To avoid double spacing, change the print statement in Step 3 to: `print(line, end='')`, and see what happens!

7. Close the file using `.close()`
