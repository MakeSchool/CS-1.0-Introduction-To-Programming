# Reading Files

In this video, youâ€™ll learn how to read files from your file system into Python. This will let you
easily import large amounts of data for your program to use!

Organizations like NASA often let you download files containing data that they collect from sites
like [https://open.nasa.gov/open-data/](https://open.nasa.gov/open-data/). Importing NASA files
could give your programs information about the weather over the ocean or where each Mars rover is
traveling right now!
