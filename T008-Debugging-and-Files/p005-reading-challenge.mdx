# Reading Challenge :trophy:

Reading a file and formatting the contents in a specific way to use in your code is a common repeated task in programming. Maybe you need to format a list of patient names for a doctor to read through. Or possibly convert a text book to an audio book for your app to read to the user. Reading files over and over again sounds like a job for a custom function!

## Steps to Complete

1. Create a function called `print_file` that takes a `filename` and prints out each line of the file with its line number

2. Test your function using the `languages.txt` file as input!
