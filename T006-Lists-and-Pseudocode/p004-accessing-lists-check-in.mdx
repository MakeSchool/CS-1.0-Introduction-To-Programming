<Prompt>

What index would we use to access the item 'sleep' in this list? 

`todo = ['eat', 'sleep', 'play a game']`

</Prompt>
<Answer>

This is a tricky one! Because list indexing starts at **0** in Python and most other programming languages, the second element ("sleep") is accessed using the index **1**, like this: `todo[1]`

Oops, something went wrong when creating this list. Can you spot the error? 

`vacation_packing_list = {'shades', 'swimsuit', 'sunscreen']`

</Prompt>
<Answer>

This list was created using mismatched brackets. The syntax for a list in Python uses only **square brackets**, so we can fix this line of code by changing it to 

`vacation_packing_list = ['shades', 'swimsuit', 'sunscreen']`

Negative list indexing is a powerful tool that we can use to access a list **backwards**. What list element are we accessing in the following code snippet? 

```python
temp_data = {45, 49, 32, 36, 41]
temp_yesterday = temp_data[-2]
```

</Prompt>
<Answer>

`temp_yesterday` will be equal to the value 36.
