# Stock Prices

Let's practice creating and accessing lists in Python! Lists are commonly used to represent groups
of data points such as stock prices.

To begin, search the web for today's market summary of the stock **APPL** (Apple Inc). The summary
should include the stock's performance history for today including the Open, High, and Low values.

# Steps to Complete

1. Create a list called `stock_history` with the Open, High, and Low stock prices for APPL as float
   values. Then print the list to the Python console to check the values.

2. Use list indexing to access and print the High value of the stock for the day. Remember that the
   first value in the list is accessed with the index 0!

3. Use negative list indexing to print the Low value of the stock for the day (the last element in
   the list).

4. Using list slicing, print out both the High and Low stock prices at the same time.
