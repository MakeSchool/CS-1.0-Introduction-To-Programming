# Stock Prices

# Step 1: Create a list called stock_history with the Open, High, and Low stock prices for APPL as float values. Then print the list to the Python console check the values.

# Step 2: Use list indexing to access and print the High value of the stock for the day. Remember that the first value in the list is accessed with the index 0!

# Step 3: Use negative list indexing to print the Low value of the stock for the day (the last element in the list).

# Step 4: Using list slicing, print out both the High and Low stock prices at the same time.
