What would happen if you ran the following lines of code in the Python console? 

```python
cricket_scores = [12.4, 20]
cricket_scores[2] = 20
```

</Prompt>
<Answer>

This code would cause an `IndexError`, because the index youâ€™re trying to access does not exist yet. To add another item to the end of a list in python, we use the append method: `cricket_scores.append(20)`

The batting lineup for this baseball team is changing! How could you add a new batter, Jade, to the **beginning** of the list? 

```python
batters = ["Joe", "Jess", "Jim", "Julia"]
```

</Prompt>
<Answer>

We could prepend to the list like this: `batters.prepend("Jade")`. **OR** we could insert a new item into the list at the index 0 like this: `batters.insert(0, "Jade")`. There can be different ways to reach the same result with lists in Python!
