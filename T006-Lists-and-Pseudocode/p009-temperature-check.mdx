# Temperature Check :tea:

Practice writing pseudocode by completing this tea challenge!

A tea shop needs you to build an app that suggests the ideal temperature for brewing each of their teas. Use pseudocode to communicate how you'd approach building the app for them!

Remember to use readable keywords like **IF** and **DISPLAY** to show the logic of your solution!

## Write Your Own Pseudocode

<Challenge>

Write your own pseudocode for this app description:

You want to write a program that will suggest the ideal temperature for the type of tea the user provides. If the tea is green -> tea display 150-180 F, if the tea is oolong -> 190 - 200 F, and if the tea is black tea -> 180 - 212 F. In all other cases -> display the phrase, “I don’t recognize that tea.”
