# Kitty Kennel

Now that you can create and access lists, practice updating list values to keep track of all the pets spending their vacation in the Kitty Kennel :cat:

# Steps to Complete

1. Create a list called `cat_names` to store the names of three cats staying in the Kitty Kennel - Clawdia, Jennifur, and Furby.

2. Feeding time! You're in charge of feeding the first two cats on the list. Print out their names.

3. The kennel is getting popular and has a new customer. Append the cat "Tigi" to the list of cat names.

4. Two cats have checked out of the kennel. Remove the first two cats from the list using slicing. Remember to assign the result of the slice back to the variable name `cat_names`.

5. A cat lady wants her whole family of cats to stay at the kennel. Use the `extend()` method to add the following list of new cat names to the `cat_names` list. `["Hamster", "Dog", "Chicken"]`
