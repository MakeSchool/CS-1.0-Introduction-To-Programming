# Build A Python Poet :art:

In this project, you will write a Python program to read poetry using your own custom functions and logic!

Computer Science is a technical field, but it can be used to inspire art and other creative forms of expression. Humans artists interacting with machines can build innovative new experiences. Here are just a few examples of the ways you can use computer code as an artistic medium:

* Google has created an experimental AI-powered muse that helps you compose poetry inspired by classical American poets: [https://sites.research.google/versebyverse/](https://sites.research.google/versebyverse/)

* Drawn primarily from MoMA's collection, Thinking Machines: Art and Design in the Computer Age, 1959â€“1989 brings artworks produced using computers and computational thinking together with notable examples of computer and component design: [https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/3863](https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/3863)

* Composers taking inspiration from data can create music inspired by weather patterns, social media, or even the step tracker on a phone: [https://nathaliemiebach.com/weatherscores.html](https://nathaliemiebach.com/weatherscores.html)
