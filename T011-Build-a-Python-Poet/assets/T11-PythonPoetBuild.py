# Python Poet Build

# Step 1: Store your poem in a text file

# Step 2: Create a function called get_file_lines that takes the parameter filename and returns a list of the strings contained in the file

# Step 3: Create a function called lines_printed_backward that takes a parameter called lines_list, which is a list containing the lines of your poem.  It should print the lines of the poem in reverse and include the original line number at the beginning of each line

# Step 4: Create a function called lines_printed_random that takes a parameter called lines_list, which is a list containing the lines of your poem. It should print the lines of your poem in random order

# Step 5: Create a function called lines_printed_custom that takes at least one parameter called lines_list, which is a list containing the lines of your poem. It should print the poem in a unique way of your choice

# Step 6: Your final code should use all four functions to print out your poem backwards, randomly, and in your own custom way
