# Share Your Python Poet!

Great work creating your very own Python poet! :tada:

:movie_camera: The final step is to show off your project on social media and the course Discord. How? You could:

* Screenshot your poet writing a poem and post it with a description of the poem you chose as inspiration and how you transformed it!
* Create and upload a demo video! To create an industry quality demo video to share with your friends, other students, or as a portfolio piece: First introduce yourself, then describe the poem you chose, and finally show off each new version of the poem that your poet can write. You could record the video using the screen capture function on your computer or the camera on a cellphone.

You can also check out other student's chat bots and leave them comments and kudos.

## Demo Your Python Poet

If you would like to demo your project at one of our weekly demo sessions, sign up on the course Discord. This is a great way to practice presenting your work and see what students in every other course have been building!
