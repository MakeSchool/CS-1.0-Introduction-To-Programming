# Python Poet Walkthrough

This video shows our working version of a Python Poet that follows the project requirements! :memo:
You can follow along if you get stuck, want ideas, or just want to compare your implementation to
ours.

We chose to build a poet that writes Remember by Joy Harjo and then transforms it into backwards,
randomly, and alternating versions of the original lines.
