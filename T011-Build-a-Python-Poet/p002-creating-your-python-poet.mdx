# Python Poet Project Overview

In this project, you will combine all of your Python skills to build a poet that reads a poem and then modifies it in different, creative ways! You can either use the poem we've copied below (Remember, written by Joy Harjo) or find your own poem from a source like Project Gutenberg: [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/bookshelf/60](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/bookshelf/60)

Let's look at the components that your poet should include.

## Python Poet Requirements :memo:

Your poet should include each of these required features:

1. **Storing:** Create a text file in the project to store a poem.
2. **Reading:** Read in the poem from the text file as a list of strings representing each line of the poem.
3. **Changing:** Change the poem in different, creative ways. Your poet will reqrite the poem to read backwards, randomly, and in custom ways of your choice!
4. **Writing:** Write each version of the poem by printing them to the console.

## Get Started!

You can jump into your Python Poet build by choosing a poem or copying the following poem and then following the steps on the next page. Good luck and have fun!

Remember - Joy Harjo

Remember the sky that you were born under,
know each of the star's stories.
Remember the moon, know who she is.
Remember the sun's birth at dawn, that is the
strongest point of time. Remember sundown
and the giving away to night.
Remember your birth, how your mother struggled
to give you form and breath. You are evidence of
her life, and her mother's, and hers.
Remember your father. He is your life, also.
Remember the earth whose skin you are:
red earth, black earth, yellow earth, white earth
brown earth, we are earth.
Remember the plants, trees, animal life who all have their
tribes, their families, their histories, too. Talk to them,
listen to them. They are alive poems.
Remember the wind. Remember her voice. She knows the
origin of this universe.
Remember you are all people and all people
are you.
Remember you are this universe and this
universe is you.
Remember all is in motion, is growing, is you.
Remember language comes from this.
Remember the dance language is, that life is.
Remember.
