# Python Poet Build

Follow these steps to build your project :art: Remember the resources that you can refer to if you are looking for direction or need to ask a question:

* The Python Poet Project Outline on the previous page
* The project walkthrough with our version of the poet on the following page
* Any of the previous course topics
* The course Discord channel

## Steps to Complete

1. Store your poem in a text file.  You can use the poem on the project spec page: Remember by Joy Harjo or find your own using a site like Project Gutenberg.

2. Create a function called `get_file_lines` that takes the parameter `filename` and returns a list of the strings contained in the file.

3. Create a function called `lines_printed_backward` that takes a parameter called `lines_list`, which is a list containing the lines of your poem.  It should print the lines of the poem in reverse and include the original line number at the beginning of each line.

4. Create a function called `lines_printed_random` that takes a parameter called `lines_list`, which is a list containing the lines of your poem. It should print the lines of your poem in random order. Repeats are ok, but make sure the number of lines printed is equal to the original lines in the poem (Line numbers do not need to be printed.) Hint: try using a loop and the `randint()` method from the random module.

5. Create a function called `lines_printed_custom` that takes at least one parameter called `lines_list`, which is a list containing the lines of your poem. It should print the poem in a unique way of your choice.  You can be creative with adding input parameters, using external modules, or even formatting the text to look like art.

6. Your final code should use all four functions to print out your poem backwards, randomly, and in your own custom way.
