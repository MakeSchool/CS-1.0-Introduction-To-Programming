# Reflecting on your goals

When you started this course, you had some assumptions, expectations, and goals. Let's take a few
minutes to reflect on the course by looking back at where you were when you started, and looking
forward to what you plan to do next.

<>
  {[
    'What were your goals when you started this course?',
    'In what ways have you reached those goals through the course?',
    'What parts of your goals do you still have to accomplish?',
    'What were your expectations at the start of the course? What surprised you along the way?',
    'What are you proud of from the course?',
    'What are you still confused about?',
    'What are you excited to learn about next?',
  ].map(reflectionQuestion => (
    <TextResponse prompt={reflectionQuestion} />
  ))}
</>

Thanks for taking the time to reflect.
