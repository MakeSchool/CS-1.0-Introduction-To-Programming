# Breaking It Down

It's important to be able to break down code that have written or find from another author to explain and understand exactly how it works. Practice breaking down our version of the Chat Bot project to explain what the code is doing.

## Steps to Complete

1. Here is our version of the Chat Bot project! On a piece of paper, practice breaking down this code with the next 2 steps to explain how it works to someone else. 

2. Write a piece of pseudocode that demonstrates how the chat bot logic works.

3. Draw a diagram showing the components of the chat bot. One way to do this could be to put each component (user input, response function, etc) in a square and connect them with arrows.
