# A Call for Feedback

Congratulations - you've reached the end of the course! ðŸ¥³

As you might have noticed - this course (and this platform) is in beta. It's just getting started,
and we know we can make it better.

As one of the first few students to complete the course, we'd really like to hear about your
experience - what worked, what didn't work, and what we should improve.

## Ways to give feedback

As you've (hopefully) seen before: there's a **[Discord group](https://discord.gg/SuXwAxNQrs)**
where students and staff can discuss the course. The
**[#feedback channel](https://discord.gg/SuXwAxNQrs)** is open for your ideas and suggestions!

At the bottom of every page in the course, there's a **comment section**. We (the team behind this
course) get notified when there's a new comment, so you can leave feedback directly on the page.
This is particularly helpful when there's a specific issue with that page, but we'll see any general
feedback left there too!

If you're willing, we also have a more in-depth **[Course Survey](make.sc/beta-feedback)**. It takes
10-15 minutes, and asks all about the course.

Finally, we'd like to meet you!
**[Schedule time to meet with one of the course architects with Calendly](https://calendly.com/course-feedback/30min)**.
We do meetings over Zoom, and would love to hear your thoughts about the course or answer lingering
questions you have.
