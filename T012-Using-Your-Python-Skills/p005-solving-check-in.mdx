Given this function description, list some **test inputs** that you would use to check if the
function worked or not.

`median` takes in a list of numbers and returns the median number - the one that's in the middle
when the numbers are sorted.

</Prompt>
<Explanation>

To test the `median` function, you could pass in different lists of numbers.

Here are some cases you might check:

- The empty list, `[]`
- A list with just one number, like `[7]`
- Lists with odd number of items: `[1,2,3]`
- Lists with an even number of items: `[1,2,3,4]`
- Lists where the items are not sorted: `[5, 2, 15, 3, 6]`
- Lists with some floats and negative numbers: `[-2, 5.6, 8, -10]`

You could also pass in some invalid inputs, to make sure the `median` function responds with a
meaningful error:

- a number `5`
- a list with a string `['hello']`

Given this function description, list some **test inputs** that you would use to check if the
function worked or not.

`excerpt` takes in a string of text, and returns the first 150 characters.

</Prompt>
<Explanation>

To test the `excerpt` function, you could pass in different strings of text.

Here are some cases you might check:

- An empty string `''`
- A string shorter than 150 characters
- A string longer than 150 characters

You could also pass in some invalid inputs, to make sure the `excerpt` function responds with a
meaningful error:

- a number `5`
- a list `[]`

This code snippet checks that both values are greater than 50. The code is correct, but doesn't use
good style.

What could you improve about this code?

```python
def check(l,m):
  # print(l,m)
  if l < m:
    if l > 50:
      return True
    else:
      # if m > 50:
      #     return True
      return False
  else:
    if m > 50:
      return True
    else:
      return False
```

List out changes to this code easier for other developers to understand.

There's lots wrong with this code. Here's some style improvements:

First, there's some commented-out code that is cluttering up the function. Delete it!

Next, the name of the function and its inputs are not very helpful. The function could be named
`greater_than_50` instead of `check`. Choosing the right name is hard, but it's usually better for
the name to be specific than vague. `l` and `m` might be better named too.

Any time there's an `if` statement that returns `True` and `False` from either branch, there's a
chance to make it simpler.

```python
if m > 50:
  return True
else:
  return False
```

is the same as

```python
return m > 50
```

`m > 50` turns into `True` or `False`, so it's the same as returning that value.

Here's an improved version of the function:

```python
def greater_than_50(num1, num2):
  if num1 < num2:
    return num1 > 50
  else:
    return num2 > 50
```

Better, but there's still improvements to make.

Instead of finding the smaller number, then checking that the smaller number is greater than 50, the
code can be rewritten more clearly to check that `num1` _and_ `num2` are greater than 50.

```
def greater_than_50(num1, num2):
  return num1 > 50 and num2 > 50
```

Much nicer.

Without writing the code, draw up a plan for solving the following problem:

> You're writing software for a movie theater company. You're asked to write the part of the
> software that handles age verification for tickets. Given a movie's rating and the ages of the
> group attending the movie, your code needs to decide whether they are allowed to buy the tickets.
>
> For instance, a group of 11-year-olds are not allowed to buy tickets to see a PG-13 movie.

Say your friend has written a chatbot like the one you built for your project.

What could you do to check that the program works correctly?

</Prompt>
<Answer>

You could read the code, and try to see if there are errors, but it's easy to miss how something
could go wrong.

Some ways of checking are:

- try the chatbot out yourself, with different answers (Quality Assurance, or Manual Testing)
- write out test cases to run in Python (Automated Testing)

Write a plan in pseudocode to solve the following problem (don't write the actual code):

> You're tasked with writing the portion of a map application that figures out the travel time to a
> destination. Your code will get the start and destination coordinates and the user's mode of
> travel as inputs.

</Prompt>
<Explanation>

There's lots of ways to break this problem down. Here's one strategy, that uses the straight-line
distance.

```
// Use the distance formula to calculate the straight-line distance between the points
// Look up the speed of travel for the user's mode of transportation
// Divide the distance by the speed of travel
```

It may feel like cheating to say "use the distance formula" in the pseudocode, but pseudocode is
allowed to take shortcuts like that. So long as you have a formula, and are confident that it can be
translated into code, you can say things like "use the formula".

When it's time to put the formula into code, it can be helpful to write pseudocode for the distance
formula too:

```
// Distance formula:
// (start_x - end_x), squared
// (start_y - end_y), squared
// add those together, then take the square root
```

Since it's a smaller piece of the larger program, it looks a little closer to actual Python.
