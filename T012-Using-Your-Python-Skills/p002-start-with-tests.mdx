# Start With Tests

Test Driven Development (TDD) is a style of programming in which you convert your software requirements - all the pieces of code that you need to build - into **test cases** before you jump into writing your program.

The best approach to the Python Poet project would have been to write a test (or two or three!) for each of the functions you needed to write **before** filling in the code blocks. These tests should cover both the expected behavior of your code as well as edge cases. What happens if your poem file is blank? Or the poem contains only one character? 

Let's practice using a Test Driven approach!

## Steps to Complete

1. Here are the empty functions for our version of the Python poet - write tests for each function by printing out what the returned value would be for 2 different inputs. You can follow the example shown for the first function!
