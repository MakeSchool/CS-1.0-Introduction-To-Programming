# What's next

Congratulations on completing the content of Introduction to Programming!

You've learned lots of new concepts, and built some cool projects. You're not an expert yet, but
you're on your way.

Let's look forward to some of the possibilities ahead of you.

## More Python

You've just scratched the surface of all there is to do with Python. Now that you've got a handle on
the basics, you can branch out and try learning and making other kinds of programs.

Here's some ideas for what you might do next:

If you're interested in **Making Games**: Check out this
[Repl.it tutorial](https://replit.com/talk/learn/A-Starter-Guide-to-Pygame/11741) on
[Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) and
[Make your first Pygame program](https://replit.com/talk/learn/Make-your-first-Pygame/11773)

Robots! Devices! Hardware! The Internet of Things! Python is a great language for **programming
electronics**. There's a ton of great tutorials out there, depending on what you'd like to make and
what hardware you have. Be warned: programming hardware introduces a whole new set of challenges
compared to Repl.it!

If you're curious to learn about backend web programming, your python knowledge is a great starting
point. Flask and Django are the most popular backend web libraries. We recommend learning Flask
first, and then learning Django once you've build a few smaller websites with Flask. The
[Official Flask Tutorial](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/tutorial/) is a good starting
point. The
[Flask Mega-tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)
has more to learn once you have a foothold. After you've gotten a sense for what backend programming
is all about, you could check out the
[Django Tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/intro/tutorial01/).

If you love **problem solving, puzzles, and math**, Python can be a lot of fun!
[Exercism](https://exercism.io/tracks/python), [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives),
and [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) are good sources of coding puzzles to sink your teeth
into.

Python is a favorite tool for **Data Science**. If you're curious about data, check out the
[Data Science Learning Roadmap](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/data-science-learning-roadmap/) or
start learning
[Python tools for data analysis](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-data-science-course-matplotlib-pandas-numpy/).

Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision all depend on the
basic tools of Data Science. If you're curious about teaching machines to learn, click the Data
Science link above!

## More Programming

There's lots more programming to learn!

Python isn't the only language out there - not by a mile. People keep making up new languages all
the time. Depending on what you want to build or work on, there's different languages to learn.

If you want to **build websites**, you'll need to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While they're
three different languages, they act in concert, so it's not three times as hard as learning Python.

If you want to make **mobile apps**, you'll need to learn Swift for iOS, or Java for Android
development. There are also new tools for building mobile apps with JavaScript, so if you learn
JavaScript for web development, it can double up as a tool for making mobile apps too.

Python is a great tool for **backend web programming** and **data science**, but if you focus on
those topics, you'll probably also learn other tools and languages too, especially SQL.

Shared between all these different languages are the foundations of **Computer Science**. What kinds
of programs are possible? What are the limits to what we can do? How can we make computers run
faster, or with fewer errors? Python is a great language for exploring Computer Science topics like
object orientation, recursion, sorting, data structures and algorithms.

## More MakeSchool

Your journey with MakeSchool doesn't have to end here!

We're developing more courses to take on this platform. We'll let you know when there's new courses
available - the next course is shipping in the next few weeks.

MakeSchool also offers a full Bachelor's degree in Applied Computer Science. If you liked this
course, and you want to take more of our courses online or at our campus in San Francisco, you can
[learn more about the program](https://www.makeschool.com/computer-science-degree).
