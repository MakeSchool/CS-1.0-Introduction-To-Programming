# What's next

Congratulations on completing the content of Introduction to Programming!

You've learned lots of new concepts, and built some cool projects. You're not an expert yet, but
you're on your way.

Let's look forward to some of the possibilities ahead of you.

## More Python

You've just scratched the surface of all there is to do with Python. Now that you've got a handle on
the basics, you can branch out and try learning and making other kinds of programs.

Some ideas:

- Making games: Pygame
- Problem solving, Puzzles, and Math: codewars, project euler
- Making Websites: Flask and Django
- Programming devices: Robotics and the Internet of Things
- Data Science
- Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence / Deep Learning / Computer Vision

## More Programming

There's lots more programming to learn!

- Other languages and tracks (Web, Mobile, Backend, Data Science)
- Computer Science
- Other topics

## More MakeSchool

- There's more standalone tutorials, in case you want to try building specific projects
- We're developing more courses to take on this platform
- There's the full Bachelor's degree, if you'd like to learn with us and eventually graduate
