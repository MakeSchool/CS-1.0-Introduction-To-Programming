# Print Your Story

# Step 1: Replace the string value assigned to my_name with your name. Press the green run button to run the program in the code editor and print your name to the console.
my_name = "Put your name here!"
print(my_name)

# Step 2: Use print statements to print out the story of yourself! You should print at least one integer, float, boolean, and string value following the example in Step 1. Example values might be your age, pet's name, or whether you like ice cream. Remember to test your code by running it each time you add a new print statement.
