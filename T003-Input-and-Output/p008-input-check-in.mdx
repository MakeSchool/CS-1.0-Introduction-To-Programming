What would happen if we called the built-in function `input()` with no message to the user in the parentheses?

</Prompt>
<Answer>

The function still works! But there would be nothing printed to the screen to tell the user that the program was waiting for them to enter a value. This would probably be bad user design even though Python could still store the value if one was entered.
