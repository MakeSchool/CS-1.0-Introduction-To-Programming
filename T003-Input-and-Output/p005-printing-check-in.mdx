# Questions: Using the built-in function `print()`

<FlashCard>
<Prompt>

What is one reason to use the code editor rather than the console to write a program?

</Prompt>
<Answer>

The code editor allows you to save code in a Python file and run all of it at once, rather than writing each line individually every time.

<Prompt>

What will this code print out to the console?

```
print("Wind Speed")
speed = 45
print(speed)
```

</Prompt>
<Answer>

This code will print:

```
Wind Speed
45
```

We can print values directly or store them in a variable and then access that variable with its name to print the value.
