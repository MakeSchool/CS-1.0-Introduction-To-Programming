# Create Your Own Custom Calculator

It's time to put all of your Python skills together and write an interactive program that performs a useful task!

In the following exercise, you'll put together a custom calculator similar to the snowboard length calculator that we created in the last video. Remember that you can always review the code from the video for ideas.

Feel free to pick any calculation of your choice :1234: You could make a calculator to convert flour measurements from cups to weight for baking or a calculator to tell you how many gallons of water will fit in a swimming pool of a certain size, be creative! After you're done, you'll have the chance to share your work with other students on the course Discord.

## Get Started!

<TextResponse>
<Prompt>

Plan out the details of your calculator! Write down the expression it will solve, what values it needs as input, and what it will print to the user as the result.

A snowboard calculator would use this information:

* The calculator will use this expression `length = height * 2.54 * 0.88`
* The user will input their height
* The calculator will print out the necessary snowboard length

## Optional Extras

<Challenge>

Once you've completed your first calculator version, feel free add extra features! Some ideas might be:
* Print out the equation that your calculator uses
* Print an ascii art logo for your calculator
* Ask the user for their name and greet them at the start of the program
