# Shopping Receipt

Let's look at how we could use Python printing to manage an online store :dollar: In this scenario,
you own an online store and want to send important messages to the shoppers on your site.

## Steps to Complete

1. In the new version of Python, we can use f-string syntax as an easier way to print variables in
   sentences without needing to use type casting. :bulb: Take a look at the f-string to print the
   cart total and run the program to see what happens!

2. You can even use expressions in your f-string! Update the f-string from Step 1 to add 5 dollars
   to the `cart_total` by putting the expression `5 + cart_total` in the curly braces. Test your
   update by running the program again.

3. The minimum for free shipping at your online store is $25. Use the f-string syntax to print a
   message telling the user how much they need to add to their cart total to qualify for free
   shipping. For example: `Joi, you are $2 away from free shipping!`.
