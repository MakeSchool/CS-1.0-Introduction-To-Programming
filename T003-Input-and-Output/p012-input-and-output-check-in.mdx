# Check your Input and Output knowledge

<FlashCard>
<Prompt>

What are two cases where you might want to use the built-in function print() to display information from your code the the console?

</Prompt>
<Answer>

There are many reasons to display output from your code, but two might be:

* To tell the user the result of a data operation, like you did in your custom calculator :abacus:
* To check for yourself what is happening in the code. Printing messages or values from your code to make sure it is working is called print debugging, and we'll talk about it more later!

```python

cups_coffee = 2
