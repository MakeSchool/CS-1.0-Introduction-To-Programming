# Print Your Story

The built-in print function 

## Steps to Complete

1. Replace the string value assigned to `my_name` with your name. Press the green run button to run the program in the code editor and print your name to the console.

2. Use print statements to print out the story of yourself! You should print at least one integer, float, boolean, and string value following the example in Step 1. Example values might be your age, pet's name, or whether you like ice cream :icecream: Remember to test your code by running it each time you add a new print statement.

:trophy: Looking for an extra challenge? Try printing out the result of a data operation like adding two strings together! Or create ascii art by printing out a set of characters that create an image. For example, you could draw a cat:

```
(`.
 ) )
( (
 \ \
  \ \
.-'  `-.
/        `.
(      )    `-._ ,    _
)   ,'         (.\--'(
\  (         ) /      \
\  \_(     / (    <6 (6
 \_)))\   (   `._  .:Y)__
  '''  \   `-._.'`---^_)))
        `-._ )))       ```
             ```
```
