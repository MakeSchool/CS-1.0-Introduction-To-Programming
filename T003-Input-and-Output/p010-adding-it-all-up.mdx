# Custom Calculator

It's time to put all of your Python skills together and write an interactive program that performs a
useful task! On the last page, you chose a custom calculator theme and calculation to perform
:abacus: Create your own custom calculator, and remember that if you get stuck, you can always look
at the snowboard calculator that we created in the video lesson as a guide.

## Steps to Complete

1. Write a comment at the top of this file explaining what your custom calculator will be
   calculating.

2. Print an explanation for the user that tells them what your calculator does.

3. Use the built-in function `input()` to prompt the user for the values that the calculator uses.
   Remember to store them with descriptive variable names!

4. Write the expression that uses the input values from your user and calculates a result.

5. Print out the result for the user. Remember to give details like the units of the value and
   instructions on how to use it.
