# Getting the Best Course Experience

Many companies that you might work with as a software engineer create something called a culture deck. The purpose of a culture deck is to present the values of a company and guide the experience of employees as they work together to build new solutions.

We've created a culture deck for this course, which you can use to guide your journey to the best possible experience learning these computer science foundations with other students around the world! :earth_africa:

Here are the 5 strategies from the course culture deck that you can use to get the best possible course experience.

**Share your Experience**
* This course has been taken by other students all around the world
* Any challenge you run into while learning computer science has been faced by other students before
* Share your own experiences to encourage others after you

**Trend Upward**
* Becoming an expert in a day is an impossibly hard task
* Let's take a different approach! If you improve by just 1% every day, that's 37 times better after just a year

**Engage Meaningfully**
* This course is built around active learning
* Projects and assessments are meant to help you engage and check your own understanding
* Take your coding confidence to the next level by reviewing material to cement your skills

**Recognize Imposter Syndrome**
* We all run into it! Imposter Syndrome is feeling like you aren't good enough or don't belong
* Recognizing when you run into imposter syndrome is the first step to combating it
* Take a deep breath, recognize your achievements, and remember that **everyone** runs into roadblocks while learning to code 

**Be Relentlessly Resourceful**
* Others want to help! You can always ask
* Who has shared this journey with you and might be able to help? Be creative in finding solutions online and from others
* Use the Discord community to talk to other students engaging with the same course material
