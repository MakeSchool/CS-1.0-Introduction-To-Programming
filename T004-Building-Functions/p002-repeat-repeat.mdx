# Repeat Repeat

Let's think about another example that shows how useful **functions** will be in your programming
toolbox :wrench:

In this scenario, you're going to volunteer as a software engineer for a local library! The library
needs a program that will tell their users how many books they currently have checked out.

<TextResponse>
<Prompt>

What lines of code could you write to store a user's name, store their number of books checked out,
and then print out how many books that they have checked out right now?

</Prompt>

<Answer>

Your library card code might look like this:

username = "Cleo" books_checked_out = 7 print(f"Hi {username}! You have {books_checked_out} books
checked out!")

</Answer>
</TextResponse>

Ok, so now if we want to do that for even just 50 library card holders ... phew that's a lot of
code!

<Idea>

Functions will allow us to write **reusable** blocks of code and repeat with inputs like usernames
that can change each time. No need to rewrite the same lines of code over and over again!

</Idea>
