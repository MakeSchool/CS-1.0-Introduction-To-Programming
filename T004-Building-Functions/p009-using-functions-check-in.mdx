If you want to use this function, what code would you write?

```
def area(width, height):
    return width * height
```

</Prompt>
<Answer>

To call this function, pass in values for the width and height, like:

```
area(10, 7)
area(22, 18)
```

If you have variables with your width and height, you can pass in the variables:

```
x = 91
y = 35
area(x, y)
```
