# Functions Practice

Functions are a foundational building block of programming and you'll use them in almost every
program you write. Since this is such an important skill, let's review what we've learned about
functions so far! Follow the tutorial below to really cement your understanding :brain:

## Part 1: Let's define a Python function!

A function is like a reusable recipe.

Take a look at the function below that computes the area of a rectangle:

```python
def area(width, height):
    result = width * height
    return result
```

In Python the keyword `def` tells Python that you are about to define a function.

`def` is followed by the name of the function and the parameters are put inside parentheses ( ) and
separated by commas.

Indented under the function name is the action code (or code block) that does something to process
the parameters.

Finally in order to get the result the function must return something using the `return` keyword.

**Task:** Copy the above `area()` function definition into the code editor.

## Part 2: How can we use our function?

Once you have defined a function we can now use it in our code!

To use a function we have defined we need to "call" the function.

To call a function you write the function name followed by parentheses and then you provide values
to the function inside the parentheses like below:

```python
result = area(5, 6)
print(result)
```

**Task:** Copy this function call and print() statement into the code editor and see what happens
when you run it.

<Prompt>

What would you see if you commented out the print statement? Why?

</Prompt>

<Explanation>

Because the area function returns a value, we can use that value in our code and assign it a
variable. However, returning a value does not print that value to the console. This means that
without our print statement we don't see what the function returned.

## Part 3: Fill in the blanks

Now that we've gotten some more practice writing function definitions and calling functions, let's
work on filling in the blanks of an incomplete function called `subtract` that takes in two numbers
and subtracts the second number from the first number:

```python
___ subtract(num1, num2):
	___ = num1 - num2
	___ result

```

**Task:** Fill in the blanks by writing the completed subtract function in the code editor. Then
call your function and print out the result to test it.

## Part 4: Last step!

Great! Good job so far! Now we are ready for the next step, creating a function from a written
description. This is what you'll do when writing your own programs or creating functions in a
software engineering job.

Consider this description: "Write a function called `divide()` which takes in two numbers and
returns the first number divided by the second number"

To write this function definition we first need to identify what the inputs or parameters are and
then what the output should be or what the function should return.

**Task:** Write the divide function in the code editor. Then call it and print the result. Check
your solution using the card below when you are done!

<FlashCard>
<Prompt>

What could a working implementation of the divide function look like?

</Prompt>
<Answer>

```
def divide(num1, num2):
	result = num1 / num2
	return result
```

</Answer>

## You did it!

Great work putting together all of the pieces to write functions from a description just like you
would when working as a software engineer :tada:
