# Add Ten

Functions are a powerful computer science tool that you'll use in almost every programming lanugage.
Practice wrapping up a repeatable task in a function by creating functions that handle math
operations :1234:

## Steps to Complete

1. Take a look at our function named `add_ten`. What happens if you run this code?

2. Change the `add_ten` function to add twenty instead. Remember to update the descriptive variable
   and function names as well as the expression in the function!

3. Write a new function called `subtract_twenty` that takes in an integer parameter and returns the
   integer minus 20. If you get stuck, look at each part of the `add_ten` function. Remember to add
   a comment that describes what your function does!

4. Call `subtract_twenty` with the value `40` and print the result in the same way we did with the
   `add_ten` function in Step 1. We'll talk more about calling functions in the next video lesson.
