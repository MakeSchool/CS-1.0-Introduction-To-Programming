# Check your Functions knowledge

<FlashCard>
<Prompt>

In a function definition, what's the **term for placeholders**?

Parameters

<MultipleChoice correct={3}>

What's the **error** in this code?

```
def make_pancakes()
    print("mix batter")
    print("cook on hot griddle")
    print("serve and eat")
```

1. No `return` statement
2. Missing function parameters
3. Missing `:` after definition

Python needs a colon (`:`) after the parentheses in a function definition. The corrected function would be

```
def make_pancakes():
    print("mix batter")
    print("cook on hot griddle")
    print("serve and eat")
```

</MultipleChoice>

<MultipleChoice correct={2}>

Be careful: this function has a typo!

What will be printed out when this code runs?

```
def add_numbers(first, second):
    return first + first

result = add_numbers(10, 25)
print(result)
```

1. 50
2. 20
3. 35
4. It's a syntax error, so it won't run.

The function's author made a mistake: this function adds `first` to itself.

Because of the error, it adds 10 to 10, so the result is 20.

In your words, explain the difference between using `return` and using `print` in a function

</Prompt>
<Explanation>

`print` outputs the value to the console.

`return` hands a value back to where the function was called, so that the caller can use the value there.
