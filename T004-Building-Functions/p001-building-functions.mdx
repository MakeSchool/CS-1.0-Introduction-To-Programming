# Building Functions

Streamline and reuse your code with Python functions!

Walking robots are very complex machines that require many lines of code to operate. If you were
building a walking robot, would you want to write out every line of code to lift a leg each time you
wanted it to take a step? It would be way easier to package lots of walking code into one command,
or function, called walk_forward to use instead!

Functions are a computer science foundation that you’ll use in most programs that you write, so
let’s get started.
