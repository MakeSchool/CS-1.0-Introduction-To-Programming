# Greetings

Now you know how to make your functions even more flexible with different kinds of parameters

## Steps to Complete

1. Define a function called `add_hello` that takes in a string parameter representing a name and
   returns a new string with the name and ' hello!'. For example, if I used the string value `Jess`,
   the function would return the string `Jess hello!`. Remember to add a comment explaining what
   your function does.

2. Call your function twice and add the results together to greet two people at once.

3. Define a function that takes two string parameters: a person's name and their pet's name. Then
   return a string that greets both of them!
