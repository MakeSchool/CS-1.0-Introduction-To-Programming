    <Prompt>

There are two problems with the syntax of this Python function. Can you find them both?

```
def wash_dishes()
print("Wash with soap")
print("Rinse with hot water")
```

    </Prompt>
    <Answer>

There were two problems with `wash_dishes`. The function's code block isn't indented, so Python won't know its part of the function. Second, the function definition is missing the colon that tells Python the code block is following. Here is the correct function:

```
def wash_dishes():
	print("Wash with soap")
	print("Rinse with hot water")
```
