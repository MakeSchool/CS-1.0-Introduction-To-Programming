# Add Ten

# Step 1: Take a look at our function named add_ten below. What happens if you run this code?

# Add ten to a number
def add_ten(number):
	new_number = number + 10
	return new_number

plus_ten = add_ten(60)
print(plus_ten)

# Step 2: Change the add_ten function to add twenty instead. Remember to update the descriptive variable and function names as well as the expression in the function!

# Step 3: Write a new function called subtract_twenty that takes in an integer parameter and returns the integer minus 20. If you get stuck, look at each part of the add_ten function. Remember to add a comment that says what your function does!

# Step 4: Call subtract_twenty with the value 40 and print the result in the same way we did with the add_ten function. We'll talk more about calling functions in the next video lesson.
