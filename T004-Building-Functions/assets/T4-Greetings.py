# Greetings

# Step 1: Define a function called add_hello that takes in a string parameter representing a name and returns a new string with the name and ' hello!'. For example, if I used the string value Jess, the function would return the string Jess hello!. Remember to add a comment explaining what your function does.

# Step 2: Call your function twice and add the results together to greet two people at once.

# Step 3: Define a function that takes two string parameters: a person's name and their pet's name. Then return a string that greets both of them!
