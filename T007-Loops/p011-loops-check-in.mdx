In order to create a self-driving car, you would need to write code that might loop through a lot of different actions over and over again. What is one part of driving that you might use a while loop to program? What is one piece that might use a for loop?

</Prompt>
<Explanation>

* One example of a while loop might be a loop that tells the car to keep moving **while** there is no stop light in sight.
* One example of a for loop might be a loop that tells the car to drive to each destination in a list of destinations.

Let's say you want to create a ticketing app for your local movie theater. You want the app to run a loop that contains all of the code to make a ticket purchase but stop running when the time is 11pm and the theater is closing. What type of loop would you use for this app?

</Prompt>
<Answer>

To build the ticketing agent, you could create an infinite loop using `while True:` and place all of the code to handle a ticket purchase in the loop. Then, at the end of the loop - after each purchase - check to see if the local time is 11pm. If so, break the loop!
