# Breaking While Loops

It's time to break some code! :hammer:

## Steps to Complete

1. Run the first while loop and see what happens!

2. Try changing the `break` keyword to `continue`. What happens now?

3. Try changing the order of the lines in the loop. What happens if you place the print statement after the conditional? After the counter increment? Play around with the different ways you can break loops in Python!
