# Breaking While Loops

It's time to break some code! :hammer:

## Steps to Complete

1. Run the following while loop and see what happens!

2. Try changing the break keyword to continue. What happens now?

3. Try changing the order of the lines in the loop. What happens if you place the print statement after the conditional? The counter increment? Play around with the different ways you can break loops in Python!
