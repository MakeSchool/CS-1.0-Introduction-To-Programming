# Making While Loops

While loops are used to iterate an **indefinite** number of times. We might not know what the number of iterations in a piece of code will be because the starting value changes over time. Or maybe we need to loop through temperature readings from Mars and don't know how many our rover was able to collect. Any time we don't know exactly how many times we need to iterate, while loops can handle it for us! Try creating two different while loops following the steps below.

## Steps to Complete

1. It's sale season, and the prices of socks are dropping every day by $0.70 at a large department store. Use a while loop to print the value of the variable `price`. It should decrease by $0.70 each iteration, as long as it remains positive.

2. Use a while loop to print the even numbers between 0 and 20.
