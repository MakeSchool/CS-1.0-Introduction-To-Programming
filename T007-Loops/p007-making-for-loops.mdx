# Making For Loops

For loops are used for **definite** iteration. Try out the following exercise to loop a known number
of times in your code.

## Steps to Complete

1. Use a for loop to print out each color in the list `colors`

2. There are 2 ways that you could solve step 1 in Python ... can you solve it the other way now?
   (Hint: If you used the keyword `in` last time, try using `len()` this time, or vice versa)

3. Create a list of names with three of your favorite people's names. Use a for loop to print out
   each name with " is awesome!" added after each name.
