<Prompt>

You are the new owner of an app called musicify! If you wanted to loop through every song that a
user has in a playlist, would you use a **for** loop or a **while** loop?

</Prompt>
<Answer>

That means that this is a use for **definite** iteration, and we can use a for loop to iterate
through each song in the list of songs.
