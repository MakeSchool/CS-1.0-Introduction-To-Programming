# Putting It Together

Combining loops with the other types of programming logic you've learned will let you build complex
programs that can make decisions between paths and loop actions any number of times. Let's practice
this with some singing :cake:

## Steps to Complete

1. Prompt the user for their name using `input()`.

2. Combine your while loops and conditionals skills to sing happy birthday to the user! Your code
   should print the following

```
Happy Birthday to you!
Happy Birthday to you!
Happy Birthday to {name}!
Happy Birthday to you!
```
