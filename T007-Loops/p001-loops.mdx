# Loops

Practice looping your code with for and while in Python!  

Iteration is an important foundation in computer science that lets you repeat instructions in your code as many times as you need. By combining conditionals and loops, youâ€™ll be able to write programs with more complex logic. Remember to keep using pseudocode to plan out your code flow as we start combining if statements, while loops, and for loops!
