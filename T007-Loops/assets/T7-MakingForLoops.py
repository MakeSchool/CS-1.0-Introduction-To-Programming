# Making For Loops

# Step 1: Use a for loop to print out each color in the list colors
colors = ["red", "orange", "blue", "green", "purple"]

# Step 2: There are 2 ways that you could solve step 1 in Python ... can you solve it the other way now? (Hint: If you used the keyword in last time, try using len() this time, or vice versa)

# Step 3: Create a list of names with three of your favorite people's names. Use a for loop to print out each name with " is awesome!" added after each name.
