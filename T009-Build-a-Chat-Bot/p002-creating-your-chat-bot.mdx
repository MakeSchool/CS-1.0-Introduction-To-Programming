# Chat Bot Project Overview

In this project, we will write a Python program to create a Chat Bot using conditionals, lists, and loops. Your Chat Bot will be focused on a specific topic so think about what kinds of questions you want your Chat Bot to answer!

Feel free to use any Chat Bot topic of your choice, it could be a mood bot or a bot that wants to talk about video games, be creative! After you're done, you'll have the chance to share your work both on the demo page and course Discord.

Let's look at the components that your Chat Bot should include.

## Chat Bot Requirements :robot:

Your Chat Bot should include each of these required features:

1. **Introductions:** Use print statements to greet the user and explain your chat bot theme
2. **Listening:** Get user input using the `input()` function
3. **Talking:** Create a function named `get_bot_response` that takes the parameter `user_response` and returns a string with the chat bot response. The function should use at least 2 lists to store unique bot responses and use conditionals to decide which of the response lists to select a random choice from. Example: the user response "happy" could return a response randomly chosen from a list of happy replies like "Yay!"
4. **Conversation:** Use a while loop to keep running your chat bot until the user enters done

## Get Started!

You can jump into your Chat Bot build by choosing a topic and then following the steps on the next page. Good luck and have fun!

## Optional Extras

<Challenge>

Once you've completed your first Chat Bot version, feel free add extra features! Some ideas might be:
* Expand to handle more user inputs. What else might users say?
* Use lists to extend what user inputs to map to what responses.
* Build a new Chat Bot to give yourself motivation while writing code.
