# Chat Bot Walkthrough

This video shows our working version of a Chat Bot that follows the project requirements! You can
follow along if you get stuck, want ideas, or just want to compare your implementation to ours.

What did we build? A mood bot! :smile: :frowning: This Chat Bot asks the user how they are feeling
and responds based on their mood. Jump into the video to find out what Python skills we used to make
our code talk.
