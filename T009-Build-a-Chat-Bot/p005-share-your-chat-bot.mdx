# Share Your Chat Bot!

Great work creating your very own Chat Bot! :tada:

Now that you can combine all of your Python skills into one cohesive project, the sky's the limit on what you can create moving forward.

:movie_camera: The final step is to show off your project on social media and the course Discord. How? You could:

* Screenshot a conversation with your Chat Bot and post it with a description of your bot's theme!
* Create and upload a demo video! To create an industry quality demo video to share with your friends, other students, or as a portfolio piece: First introduce yourself, then describe your Chat Bot's theme, and finally show off each cool feature that you've added. You could record the video using the screen capture function on your computer or the camera on a cellphone.

You can also check out other student's chat bots and leave them comments and kudos.

## Demo Your Chat Bot

If you would like to demo your project at one of our weekly demo sessions, sign up on the course Discord. This is a great way to practice presenting your work and see what students in every other course have been building!
