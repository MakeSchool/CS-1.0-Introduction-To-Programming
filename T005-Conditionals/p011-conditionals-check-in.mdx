# Test your knowledge of conditional statements

<MultipleChoice>
  <Prompt>

```
10 == 18
```

</Prompt>
<Choice>True</Choice>
<Choice correct>False</Choice>
  <Answer>

The `==` operator checks if two values are equal.

10 does not equal 18, so the result is False.

</MultipleChoice>

<MultipleChoice>
  <Prompt>

```
10 == 10
```

  </Prompt>
<Choice correct>True</Choice>
<Choice>False</Choice>
  <Answer>

The `==` operator checks if two values are equal.

10 equals 10, so the result is True.

<MultipleChoice>
  <Prompt>

```
5 < 4
```

</Prompt>
<Choice>True</Choice>
<Choice correct>False</Choice>
  <Answer>

The `<` operator checks if the left value is less than the right value.

5 is not less than 4, so the result is False.

  </Answer>
</MultipleChoice>

<MultipleChoice>
  <Prompt>

```
("blue" == "red") and (3 != 5)
```

</Prompt>
<Choice>True</Choice>
<Choice correct>False</Choice>
<Answer>

"blue" doesn't equal "red", so the left side is False.

3 doesn't equal 5, so the right side is True.

True and False make False.

</Answer>
</MultipleChoice>

<MultipleChoice>
  <Prompt>

```
("blue" == "blue") and (3 == 3) and (6 == 6)
```

</Prompt>
<Choice correct>True</Choice>
<Choice>False</Choice>
<Answer>

Combining multiple `and` expressions means that _all_ of the individual expressions have to be True.

In this case, each subexpression is True, so the whole thing is True.

<MultipleChoice correct={2}>

What will this code print?

```
speed_limit = 30
car_speed = 39

if car_speed < speed_limit:
    print("That's a safe speed.")
else:
    print("Too fast! Slow down!")
```

1. That's a safe speed.
2. Too fast! Slow down!

The `car_speed` is more than the `speed_limit`, so it prints "Too fast! Slow down!"

</MultipleChoice>

<MultipleChoice correct={3}>

What will this code print?

```
stoplight = "red"

if stoplight == "green":
    print("Go!")
elif stoplight == "yellow":
    print("Slow down")
elif stoplight == "red":
    print("Stop!")
```

1. Go!
2. Slow down
3. Stop!

The first two branches of the if / elif statement don't match, but the third branch does.
