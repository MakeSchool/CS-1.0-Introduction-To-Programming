# Weather Report

Imagine you are creating a program to give advice about what activities to do based on the weather.
You now know how to use conditional statements to let your code respond differently for different
weather values :sunny:

## Steps to Complete

1. Create a variable `weather` with the string value sunny

2. Write a program using a conditional statement to suggest an activity based on the weather. Your
   condtional statement should follow this logic:

```
if the weather is sunny then print "Let's go to the park!"
else if the weather is foggy print "Let's go see a movie."
else if the weather is rainy print "Let's read a book indoors."
else print "Cooking is good in any weather!"
```

3. Try out each case of your if-elif-else statement by changing the value of `weather`!
