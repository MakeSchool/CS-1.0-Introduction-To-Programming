<MultipleChoice>
  <Prompt>

```
("blue" == "red") and (3 == 5)
```

</Prompt>
<Choice>True</Choice>
<Choice correct>False</Choice>
<Explanation>

"blue" doesn't equal "red", so the left side is False.

3 doesn't equal 5, so the right side is False.

False and False make False.

<MultipleChoice>
  <Prompt>

```
("five hundred" == 500) or (5 * 100 == 500)
```

  </Prompt>
<Choice correct>True</Choice>
<Choice>False</Choice>
  <Explanation>

"five hundred" does not equal 500, so the left side is False.

5 \* 100 is 500, so the right side is True.

When either the left or the right side of `or` is True, the whole expression is True.

  </Explanation>
</MultipleChoice>

<MultipleChoice correct={1}>

```
12 == 12 and "orange" == "orange"
```

1. True
2. False

12 equals 12, so the left side is True.

"orange" equals "orange", so the right side is True.

The result of `and` is True if both the right and left side are True.
