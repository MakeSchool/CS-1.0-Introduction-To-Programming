Would Python evaluate this expression as `True` or `False`?

This expression is `True`! Let's step through the layers. Our original value is `True`. So not `True` is the opposite value - `False`. Then `not not True` would be `True` again. `not not not True` is `False`. Finally `not not not not True` is `True`.
