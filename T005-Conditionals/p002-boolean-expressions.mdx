<Prompt>

Would Python evaluate this expression as `True` or `False`?

`not not not not True`

</Prompt>
<Answer>

This expression is `True`! Let's step through the layers. Our original value is `True`. So not
`True` is the opposite value - `False`. Then `not not True` would be `True` again.
`not not not True` is `False`. Finally `not not not not True` is `True`.
