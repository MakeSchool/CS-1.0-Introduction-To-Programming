# Car Search

Complex boolean expressions are commonly used for search queries. If you are looking for a new
couch, you might search for one that is red OR blue, AND is in stock, AND costs less than $100.
Let's try combining different types of operators to decide if a used car can be traded in at the
dealership.

## Steps to Complete

1 Create a variable that stores the integer mileage `53291` for a used Mustang :car:

2. Write a boolean expression to check if the string "Mustang" is contained in the ad stored in the
   variable `car_ad`.

3. Write a boolean expression to check if the mileage variable you created is below 100,000 miles.

4. Combine the expressions you wrote in Steps 2 and 3 with a logical operator to check if you can
   trade in a Mustang and if your used Mustang is below the mileage limit. Print the result.
