# Adding Functions

Functions and conditionals are both useful building blocks to make your code repeatable and adaptable. What happens if you combine the two? Super Python powers :boom:

## Steps to Complete

1. Write a function that takes in the temperature in degrees F. If the temperature is greater than 50, return "It's hot!". Else return "Brr!". As always, remember to comment your function!

2. Call your function and print the result to test both cases.
