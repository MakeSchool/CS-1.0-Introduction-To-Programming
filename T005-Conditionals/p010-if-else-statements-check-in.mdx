# Knowledge Check: If Else Statements

Try to answer the questions below.

_If_ you know the answers, that's cool!

_Else_, that means you're learning, which is even better.

What keyword do you use for the code to run when an `if` statement _does not_ match?

<MultipleChoice correct={1}>

What will this code print?

```
speed_limit = 30
car_speed = 22

if car_speed < speed_limit:
    print("That's a safe speed.")
else:
    print("Too fast! Slow down!")
```

1. That's a safe speed.
2. Too fast! Slow down!

The `car_speed` is less than the `speed_limit`, so it prints "That's a safe speed."

</MultipleChoice>

<MultipleChoice correct={2}>

What will this code print?

```
speed_limit = 30
car_speed = 39

if car_speed < speed_limit:
    print("That's a safe speed.")
else:
    print("Too fast! Slow down!")
```

1. That's a safe speed.
2. Too fast! Slow down!

The `car_speed` is more than the `speed_limit`, so it prints "Too fast! Slow down!"

</MultipleChoice>

<MultipleChoice correct={3}>

What will this code print?

```
stoplight = "red"

if stoplight == "green":
    print("Go!")
elif stoplight == "yellow":
    print("Slow down")
elif stoplight == "red":
    print("Stop!")
```

1. Go!
2. Slow down
3. Stop!

The first two branches of the if / elif statement don't match, but the third branch does.

</MultipleChoice>

There's lots of things! Here's some examples:

- Print a different message, based on the user's input
- Show a different message if a user is logged in or logged out
