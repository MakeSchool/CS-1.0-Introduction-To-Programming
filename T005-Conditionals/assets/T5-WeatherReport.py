# Weather Report

# Step 1: Create a variable weather with the string value sunny

# Step 2: Write a program using a conditional statement to suggest an activity based on the weather. Your condtional statement should follow this logic:
# if the weather is sunny then print "Let's go to the park!"
# else if the weather is foggy print "Let's go see a movie."
# else if the weather is rainy print "Let's read a book indoors."
# else print "Cooking is good in any weather!"

# Step 3: Try out each case of your if-elif-else statement by changing the value of weather!
