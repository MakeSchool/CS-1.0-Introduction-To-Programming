# Step 1: Create a variable that stores the integer mileage 53291 for a used Mustang. 

# Step 2: Write a boolean expression to check if the string "Mustang" is contained in this car ad.
car_ad = "This week only! Trade-ins for any Mustang or Challenger under 100,000 miles!"

# Step 3: Write a boolean expression to check if the mileage variable you created is below 100,000 miles.

# Step 4: Combine the expressions you wrote in Steps 2 and 3 with a logical operator to check if you can trade in a Mustang and if your used Mustang is below the mileage limit. Print the result.
