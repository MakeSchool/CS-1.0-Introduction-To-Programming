```
("blue" == "red") and (3 == 5)
```

</Prompt>
<Choice>True</Choice>
<Choice correct>False</Choice>
<Explanation>

"blue" doesn't equal "red", so the left side is False.

3 doesn't equal 5, so the right side is False.

False and False make False.

  <Prompt>

```
("blue" == "blue") and (3 == 3) and (6 == 6)
```

</Prompt>
<Choice correct>True</Choice>
<Choice>False</Choice>
<Explanation>

Combining multiple `and` expressions means that _all_ of the individual expressions have to be True.

In this case, each subexpression is True, so the whole thing is True.
