## What's the result?

<MultipleChoice correct={1}>

```
12 == 12 and "orange" == "orange"
```

1. True
2. False

12 equals 12, so the left side is True.

"orange" equals "orange", so the right side is True.

The result of `and` is True if both the right and left side are True.

</MultipleChoice>

<FlashCard>
<Prompt>

```
("five hundred" == 500) or (5 * 100 == 500)
```

</Prompt>
<Answer>

`True`

"five hundred" does not equal 500, so the left side is False.

5 \* 100 is 500, so the right side is True.

When either the left or the right side of `or` is True, the whole expression is True.

<FlashCard>
<Prompt>

```
(100 == 2 * 50) and ("200" == 200)
```

</Prompt>
<Answer>

`False`

100 does equal 2 times 50, but the string "200" is not equal to the number 200.

Both sides of an `and` have to be True for the result to be True.

<FlashCard>
<Prompt>

```
wind_speed = 15
not (wind_speed > 30)
```

</Prompt>
<Answer>

`True`

The `wind_speed` is not greater than 30, so this is true.

Thinking about this in parts:

- `wind_speed` is set to 15
- `wind_speed > 30` is `False`
- not `False` is `True`

So the whole block is `True`.
