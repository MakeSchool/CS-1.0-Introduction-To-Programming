# Which Song

Sometimes you need a specific set of songs to motivate you at the gym, help you focus at the
library, or get into the flow while writing code :headphones: Use a dictionary to keep track of a
few different playlists for different settings.

## Steps to Complete

1. Add one song to each category in the following dictionary of playlists.

2. We want to make a new playlist based on the gym playlist. Create a variable called `running` and
   assign it the value of the list stored in the `gym` key of the dictionary.

3. Use a for loop to print each song from the gym playlist.
