# Step 1: Print out the inventory dictionary below.

inventory = {'Jordan 1' : 1,
             'Yeezy'    : 8,

             'SB Dunk'  : 5,
             'Cortez'   : 20 }

# Step 2: A customer purchased 2 pairs of SB dunks. Update the inventory value and print the dictionary again.

# Step 5: Yeezy's are going out of style. Delete them from your inventory.
