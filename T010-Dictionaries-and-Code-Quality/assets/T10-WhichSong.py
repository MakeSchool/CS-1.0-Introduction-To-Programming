# Which Song

# Step 1: Add one song to each category in the following dictionary of playlists

playlists = {
  'gym'  : ['Eye of the Tiger', 'POWER', 'Level Up'],
  'study': ['White Noise', 'ChilledCow', 'Space Ambient'],
  'bbq'  : ['Before I Let Go', 'Summertime', 'Outstanding']
}

# Step 2: We want to make a new playlist based on the gym playlist. Create a variable called running and assign it the value of the list stored in the gym key of the dictionary

# Step 3: Use a for loop to print each song from the gym playlist
