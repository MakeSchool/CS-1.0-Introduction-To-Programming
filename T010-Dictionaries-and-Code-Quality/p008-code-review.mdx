# Code Review :mag:

Code review is process where someone other than the author of a piece of code checks the **quality** of a program and then gives feedback about the logic, style, testing practices, and any other aspect of the code that could be improved. 

Code reviews save time and money and are a great way to share knowledge among developers! Practice this essential software developent skill by doing your own review of the following code.

<Challenge>

Give your review of this version of the Chat Bot project! It works as expected, but try to identify at least 3 ways the author could improve their code and record them in the text response below. If you need inspiration, you can jump back to the previous lesson for a list of attributes that good quality code should have!

```python
from random import choice
def get_Bot_esponse(user_response):

  happy = ["Yay!", "That's awesome!", "Glad to hear it!"]
  response_sad = ["That's too bad", "I'm sorry to hear that"]
  if user_response == "happy":
    return choice(happy)

  elif user_response == "sad":
    return choice(response_sad)
  else:
    return("I didn't understand that")

print("Welcome to Mood Bot")
print("Please tell me if you're feeling happy or sad.")

while True:
  q = input("How are you feeling today?: ")
  if q == "done":
    break


  Bot = get_Bot_response(q)
  print(Bot)
```

# Check Your Solution

Click to see a few examples of things that we thought could have been improved in the Chat Bot code above.

<Solution>

* Consistent and readable names - some of the variable names weren't descriptive and didn't follow a standard format
* Comments - none of the functions were commented to help the reader understand their purpose!
* Consistent spacing - the spacing between lines of code is inconsistent and confusing
