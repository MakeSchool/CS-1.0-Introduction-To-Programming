# Dictionaries

## Check Your Understanding

<FlashCard>
<Prompt>

Let's go back to our musicify app! How should we represent each of these sets of values in the app code? As a **list** or as a **dictionary**?

* The songs in a single playlist?
* The number of times that each song on the app has been streamed?
* All of a user's playlists, each containing different songs?

</Prompt>
<Answer>

Let's walk through each example!

* A single playlist of songs, can be represented one single list of values - `["song1", "song2"]`
* We want to map each number of streams to the corresponding song. Sounds like a job for a dictionary! - `{"song1": 40870543, "song2": 323}`
* Here we can get fancy! Each playlist is a list of songs, but we want to map those lists to the playlist names. That means we can create a dictionary where each **key** (a song title) maps to a **value** that is of the type list (the list of songs in the playlist) like in the code block below.

```python
{"the coolest playlist title": ["song1", "song2"], 
 "the most ok playlist": ["song3", "song4"]}
```
